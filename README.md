**Abstract**
Electronic Health Records contain large amounts of useful information about patient health which cannot be capitalized on due to inconsistencies in natural language writing. This makes it very difficult to obtain useful data as one has to understand the different formats of writing in a record, and even larger amounts of useless information before obtaining the required information. The advent of Google's Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) which is a transformer-based learning technique is a solution towards the extraction of annotated words and structures from unstructured text. However, to annotate medical terms in an electronic health record with high accuracy, further training and fine tuning of the model is required. The fine-tuned BERT model created is intended to increase annotation accuracy, such that useful data from unstructured EHRs can be extracted easily. The results show that our model has an accuracy of 99% indicating it can be used to extract data from unstructured EHRs. This allows doctors, researchers and patients to obtain useful information that could be vital for diagnoses or creation of new datasets for further research in a medical domain.
